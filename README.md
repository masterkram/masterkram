### Good to Meet :call_me_hand:

Hey I am Mark, I am interested in building bootstrapped startups.

I develop software for fun and profit. I also like making some projects open source for the benefit of all.

Mainly I am experienced in web dev + mobile dev + ML.

I work at [techurve](https://techurve.nl), where I love planning, designing and building people's vision from 0 to 100%
